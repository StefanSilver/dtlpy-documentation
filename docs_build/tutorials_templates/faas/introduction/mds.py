    1. Prerequisites;
    2. Basic use case:  Single function;
    * Deploy a function as a service;
    * Execute the service manually and view the output;
    3. Advance use case: Multiple functions;
    * Deploy several functions as a package;
    * Deploy a service of the package;
    * Set trigger events to the functions;
    * Execute the functions and view the output and logs.
