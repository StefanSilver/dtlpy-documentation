    # Advanced Tutorials
    This section will provide more advanced scripts that can be used in Dataloop to perform different processes on image Annotations.
    ## Copy Annotations Between Items
    We can copy Annotations between Items by setting the Annotations entity from one Item and uploading it to another. Running a Filter through all Items allows us to copy from one Item into multiple Items, such as video snapshots with the same object.

    ## Show Images & Annotations
    This code downloads an image and its Annotations from a Dataset, displays the Annotations and the image separately, and then displays the Annotated image with the Annotations pasted onto it.
    **Note:** This script uses  Pillow and CV2, please make sure they are installed (`pip install opencv-python` and `pip install --upgrade Pillow`).

    ## Show Annotations from JSON file (Dataloop format)
    This code reads Annotation data from a JSON file in Dataloop format, generates an image mask for each Annotation, and displays the mask image for visualization purposes.
    **Note:** Directory paths look different in MacOS and Linux when compared to Windows. MacOS and Linux don'trequire "r" at the beginning of the filepath.

    ## Count total number of annotations
    The following script counts the number of Annotations with a Filter. The Filter can be set to any context - Dataset, folder or other criteria. In the following example, it is set to a Dataset.

    ## Parenting Annotations
    Parenting in image Annotations refers to the process of grouping related objects or elements within an image together. It involves creating a hierarchical relationship between the objects where one object is considered the "parent" and others are considered "children".
    
    In Dataloop, parenting establishes a relation between 2 Annotations, executed by setting the `parent_id `parameter. The Dataloop system will reject any attempt to set circular parenting. The following script demonstrates how to set the parenting relation while uploading/creating Annotations.

def section6():
    """

    The following script demonstrates how to set a parenting relation on existing Annotations. It defines a "parent" Annotation with a Bounding Box and Label, uploads it. Then creates a "child" Annotation with a Bounding Box and Label, uploads it. The it sets its parent ID to the ID of the parent Annotation. Finally, it updates the child Annotation with system Metadata to establish the parent-child relationship.

    ## Change Annotationsâ€™ Label
    The following example creates a new Label in the Recipe (an optional step, you can also use an existing Label), then applies it to all Annotations in a certain Filter.
