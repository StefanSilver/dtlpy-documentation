    # Creating Tasks
    In the Dataloop platform, Tasks are created to begin the process of data annotation or to perform Quality Assurance (QA) work. A "Task" is a unit of work that needs to be completed by an individual or a team. A Task can represent any type of activity, such as annotating data, reviewing Annotations, labeling images, performing quality assurance checks, or any other data-related Task that requires human input. Tasks in the Dataloop system are created by Project managers, who define the specific requirements for each Task, such as the type of data to be labeled, the Annotation instructions, the deadline, and the number of Annotators required. Tasks are then assigned to individual annotators or teams of Annotators who complete the Task according to the specified requirements.
    
    ## Creating a Task Using Filter
    The example below demonstrates creating a Task from an Item Filter. The script includes 2 examples, one for filtering an entire folder/directory, and another for filtering by Item Annotation status.

    ### List of Items
    The example below will show you how to create a Task from a list of Items. The Items will be divided equally between 2 Annotators specified, as Assignments.

    ### Entire Dataset
    The following example will create a Task from all of the Items in a Dataset. The Items will be divided equally between the 2 Annotators, as Assignments.

    ## Add Items to an existing Task
    This example of adding Items to an existing Task will create new Assignments (for new assignee/s).

    ### By Filters
    In the example below you can add new Items to be Annotated or to perform QA on, to existing Tasks, by using a Filter.
