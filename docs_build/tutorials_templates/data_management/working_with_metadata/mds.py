    # Working with Metadata
    Before we start working with Metadata, we need to log in. To do that, you can use a simple `dl.login()` line of code, to make sure you are logged in. After that, we must `get` the Project and the Dataset we will be working on, using the code below:

    ## User Metadata
    The Dataloop's Python SDK is a a powerful tool that can be used for managing data based on your categories and information. You can add any keys and values to the User Metadata sections of Items and Annotations. Then you can use your User Metadata to Filter, Sort, and so on.    
    
    **Note**: When adding Metadata to the same Item, the new Metadata might overwrite existing Metadata. To avoid overwriting a field or the entire Metadata, use the [list](#list) data type.

    ### Metadata Data Types
    Metadata is a dictionary attribute used with Items, Annotations, and other entities of the Dataloop system (Task, Recipe, and more). As such, it can be used with string, number, boolean, list or null types. You can see examples of these types below.
