    Because a Recipe is linked to an Ontology, changes to Labels and Attributes are possible. When a Recipe is set as the default one for a Dataset, the Dataset entity can be used to make changes to the Labels and Attributes, that are ultimately linked to it via the Recipe and its Ontology.

    ## Cloning Recipes
    When you want to create a new Recipe thatâ€™s only slightly different from an existing Recipe, it can be easier to start by cloning the original Recipe and then making changes on its clone.
    **Note:** If the 'shallow' parameter is set to 'True', the link will be set to an existing ontology. If it's set to `False`, it will clone all Ontologies that are linked to the Recipe as well.

    This code adds labels to a dataset in three different ways: 
    - Option A - adds Labels one by one. 
    - Option B - automatically generates parent and grandparent Labels if they don't exist.
    - Option C - adds Labels using a nested dictionary structure. 
    
    **Note:** Labels can have attributes like name, color, and children (sub-labels).
